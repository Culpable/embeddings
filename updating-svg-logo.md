# SVG Logo Update Documentation

## Original Issue
The original logo implementation had several issues:
1. Used incorrect viewBox dimensions (387.136 x 57.984)
2. Missing essential SVG attributes from the source file
3. Incorrect path data positioning
4. Improper transform attributes

## Step-by-Step Resolution

### 1. Initial Analysis
The original SVG file (`embeddings-final.svg`) had these key properties:
```xml
<svg
   width="131.06514mm"
   height="18.295944mm"
   viewBox="0 0 131.06515 18.295944"
   version="1.1">
   <g transform="translate(6.0559385,-63.663189)">
     <!-- path data positioned around y=87 -->
   </g>
</svg>
```

### 2. Issues Encountered

#### First Attempt
- Used custom viewBox dimensions
- Logo appeared truncated
- Path data was misaligned
```jsx
viewBox="0 0 387.136 57.984"
```

#### Second Attempt
- Tried adjusting with negative viewBox coordinates
- Logo was elevated and cut off
```jsx
viewBox="-10 70 150 25"
```

#### Third Attempt
- Added translation without proper scaling
- Logo disappeared completely
```jsx
transform="translate(0,-10) scale(1.118034,0.89442719)"
```

### 3. Final Solution
The working solution required several precise adjustments:

1. **Correct SVG Attributes**
```jsx
width="131.06514mm"
height="18.295944mm"
viewBox="0 0 131.06515 18.295944"
```

2. **Proper Transform**
```jsx
transform="translate(6.0559385,-63.663189) scale(1.118034,0.89442719)"
```

3. **Tailwind Classes**
```jsx
className={clsx(fillOnHover && 'group/logo', className, 'w-auto h-6')}
```

### 4. Key Learnings

1. **SVG Coordinate System**
   - The original SVG used a coordinate system with path data around y=87
   - Required precise translation to bring content into view
   - Scale factors needed to match original SVG (1.118034, 0.89442719)

2. **ViewBox Importance**
   - Must match original SVG dimensions exactly
   - Cannot arbitrarily adjust without considering path data positioning
   - Affects how SVG scales within container

3. **Transform Order**
   - Translation must come before scaling
   - Original transform attributes must be preserved
   - Affects final positioning and dimensions

### 5. Best Practices

1. **When Updating SVG Logos**
   - Always analyze original SVG file first
   - Preserve original viewBox dimensions
   - Maintain original transform attributes
   - Keep path data coordinates unchanged

2. **Responsive Considerations**
   - Use w-auto to maintain aspect ratio
   - Set reasonable height with Tailwind classes
   - Allow SVG to scale naturally within container

3. **Debug Process**
   - Check viewBox dimensions first
   - Verify transform attributes
   - Confirm path data positioning
   - Test with different screen sizes

### 6. Future Updates
When updating the logo in the future:
1. Extract dimensions and transforms from source SVG
2. Keep original coordinate system
3. Preserve all transform attributes
4. Test thoroughly at different sizes

This documentation should help maintain consistency when working with SVG logos in the future and provide a reference for troubleshooting similar issues.
